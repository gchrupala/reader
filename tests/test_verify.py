The Hippocampal-VTA Loop: Review
Controlling the Entry of Information
into Long-Term Memory
John E. Lisman1,* and Anthony A. Grace2 perspective: viewed in an integrated manner, these developments strongly
suggest that the hippocampus 1Department of Biology Brandeis University and VTA form a functional loop designed to
detect nov415 South Street elty and to use this novelty signal to control the entry of behaviorally significant
information into the hippocampal store of long-term memory. In this article we develop the concept that the
hippocampus and the midbrain dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) form a functional loop.
In such experiments there is a motor component that signals the animal's response, but the firing is not related
to this motor component; learning and memory begin where novelty is detected."""

Elisabetta Versace,1,* Antone Martinho III,2 Alex Kacelnik,2 and Giorgio Vallortigara3
A major goal for the next generation of AI is to build machines that are able to reason and cope with novel
tasks, environments, and situations in a manner that approximates that of humans or animals. Here, we show
how insights from animal cognition can help us to identify what prior knowledge is needed (ﬁrst steps)..."""
